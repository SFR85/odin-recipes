    <h1>Bacon Conchigle Pasta Bake</h1>
    <img src="../img/baconcon.jpeg" alt="freshly cooked bacon conchigle pasta bake" width="183" height="275">
<p> This is one of my favourite weeknight recipes.</p>
<p>I like to make this mac & cheese-style dish in a large, shallow roasting tin, so you get the maximum 
    surface area for the crunchy topping. There's broccoli and spinach for added greens and a wonderful 
    savoury note from the bacon. Feel free to use any cheese you have left over in the fridge; blue cheese 
    or cheddar would work well.</p>

    <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 2 adults + 2 children.
    <br><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10 minutes.
    <br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 25-30 minutes
</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g conchiglie or other pasta shape</li>
        <li>1 large head of broccoli, chopped into small bits</li>
        <li>160g bacon lardons</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>400g crème fraîche</li>
        <li>100g spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juice only</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sea salt (optional)</li>
        <li>30g parmesan (or other) cheese, grated</li>
        <li>40g panko or fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees/200 degrees fan/gas 7. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water for 10 minutes, 
            then drain. While it is cooking, add the broccoli, lardons and thyme to a large roasting tin, mix in 1 tablespoon 
            of olive oil and roast them in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the drained pasta with another tablespoon of oil, crème fraîche, spinach, lemon juce and (optional) sea salt, 
            then add the mix to the roasting tin.</li>
        <li>Scatter the tin with the cheese and breadcrumbs, then drizzle with the last tablespoon of oil. Bake in the oven for 
            another 15-20 minutes, until the top is golden brown and crunchy.</li> 
    </ol>
