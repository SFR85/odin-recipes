    <img src="../img/cauliflower-dhal.jpg" alt="freshly cooked bowl of cauliflower and red lentil dhal topped with almonds" width="512" height="640">

<p>This is one of my favourite warming dishes. Cooking the lentils in coconut milk makes each bite much creamier, while the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, chilli and curry powder add such a lovely blend of flavours.</p>

    <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 4 adults.
    <br><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10 minutes.
    <br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 55 minutes
</p>



    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp medium curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1Â¼ cups split red lentils (200g)</li>
        <li>handful of dried apricots roughly chopped (about 6) </li>
        <li>2 cans coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>handful of baby spinach</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 240 C</li>
        <li>Melt coconut oil into a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add onion, carrots, garlic, and pinch of salt and cook until salt, around 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add curry powder, paprika, and mustard seeds and cook for a further 5 minutes, before adding the lentils and apricots. Mix well and cover with the tinned coconut milk, stirring to prevent it catching and burning. If needed, keep adding a dash of coconut or almond milk from a carton until the lentils are cooked through and the consistency is thick and a little sticky, about 30-35 minutes.</li>
        <li>While this cooks, roast the cauliflower. Put the florets into a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and some salt and pepper, and roast for 8 minutes. Remove and add the florets to the lentils and cook for a further 5-10 minutes. You want the cauliflower be cooked but still have a little bite.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach if using and leave it to wilt before serving.</li>
    </ol>
