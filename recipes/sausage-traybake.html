    <h1>Summer Sausage Traybake</h1>

<p>I usually think of sausage bakes as wintery dishes, but they work just as well with fresh courgettes, tomatoes and broccoli for a light, summery dinner.</p>

    <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 2 adults + 2 children.
    <br><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10 minutes.
    <br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 30 minutes
</p>



    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g Tenderstem or ordinary broccoli</li>
        <li>500g courgettes, cut into 5mm slices </li>
        <li>300g cherry vine tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 red onion finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, crushed </li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary </li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt flakes (optional) </li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes (optional - leave out for children) </li>
        <li>8-12 free-range chipolata sausages</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juice only</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Put the broccoli into a large bowl, pour over a kettleful of boiling water, leave 
            to stand for 1 minute, then drain well. If using ordinary broccoli, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Tip everything into a roasting tin large enough to hold it all in a single layer, and 
            mix well. Make sure the chipolata sausages are on top, then transfer to the oven and 
            bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>If your oven heats unevenly, turn the roasting tin after about 20 minutes so the sausages brown evenly.</li>
        <li>Squeeze a little lemon juice and sea salt over the vegetables to taste and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
